    // the GC from collecting script objects it may be pointing too.

    // IMarkable has no virtual destructor by design.  As it is
    // an interface and might be applied to lightweight objects,
    // I didn't want to force virtual destructors on all users of it.
    // Although the memory cost of the vtable is already paid because of the virtual mark() function,
    // presence of a virtual destructor would force all derived objects to be
    // destructed virtually, which might be an unwanted runtime cost.
